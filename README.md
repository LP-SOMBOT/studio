## 🛠 Troubleshooting Git Issues (THE NUCLEAR OPTION)

If you are stuck with "failed to push" or "authentication failed" and cannot find the profile icon (especially on mobile):

### Step 1: Open the Terminal
1. Click the **Hamburger Menu** (top-left, three horizontal lines `☰`).
2. Select **Terminal** -> **New Terminal**.

### Step 2: Run the Force Push Command
Copy and paste this exact line into the terminal and press Enter:
```bash
git push origin main --force
```

### Step 3: Handle Authentication
When you run the command above, Git will ask for your credentials:

1.  **Username**: Type your GitHub username and press Enter.
2.  **Password**: **DO NOT use your normal password.** Paste your **Personal Access Token (PAT)** here. (Note: On mobile, long-press to paste. The terminal will not show any characters while you paste/type).

## Local Development
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Note:** The onboarding flow exclusively appears when the user has installed the OskarShop PWA to their home screen and is opening it for the very first time. It will never show on a regular browser visit.
